## Introduction

Understanding travel data is crucial for making informed decisions regarding travel services, marketing strategies, and customer satisfaction. This project aims to explore various aspects of travel data through thorough analysis and visualization techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various features related to travel such as:

- ID
- TravelDate
- TravelerName
- Gender
- Age
- Country
- Destination
- TravelPurpose
- Duration
- TransportationMode
- AccommodationType
- TravelAgency
- Cost
- Satisfaction

**Note**: Ensure that the dataset is anonymized to maintain user confidentiality.
